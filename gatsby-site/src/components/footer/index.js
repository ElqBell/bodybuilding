        <p>"Everybody, one day will die, and be forgotten. Act and behave in a way that will make life interesting and fun, fuck a mundane predictable life working monday to friday with something you derive no pleasure from; just living life out till you grow old and wither. Find a passion, form relationships, don't be afraid to get out there and fuck what everyone else thinks, trust me, it's a lot more fun that way."</p>
        <p>"Because sticking up for yourself makes you look mad. Laughing at their face and saying 'u mad' is a million times more effective."</p>
        <p>"U mirin'?"</p>
        <p>"Come at me brah"</p>
        <p>"My theory is that life is a video game kind of like The Sims, and some person is controlling each and every single one of us, and whoever is controlling me has the top score. U mad?"</p>
        <p>"Pretend, before each set: someone is holding a gun to your head and you must complete x number of reps or a certain weight to survive. You will watch yourself and push harder than normal."</p>
        <p>"FUUUAAARRRK!!"</p>
        <p>"I still train when I'm sick, unless you are running a fever, then don't train. A cold? Runny nose? I still train. If I'm sore, I still train. If I'm tired, I still train."</p>
        <p>"Too many people go to the gym, do a few bicep curls and tricep pushdowns and make no progress. Use your mind to motivate you to go HARDOUT every workout, that's what will transform your body. When your body tells you to stop, keep going, because it's your mind that will ultimately make you push through it."</p>
        <p>"I don't workout for chicks, I workout to create an aura. When I walk into a room, introduce myself to someone, go for a job interview, I love looking dominant, in charge, and in control. I love walking past and having people point and talk about me, I love the fact that when I go somewhere with thousands of people, almost all of them will remember who I am when it is over, and I didn't even have to say a word."</p>
        <p>"I don't stress for exams. I stress more when I have a cheat meal."</p>
        <p>"My message is to train hard, don't be a hard cunt, enjoy life and don't take yourself too seriously. If there were more people like me, the world would be a happier place. I'd rather do what I do and have fun than sit back hating on someone achieving something."</p>
        <p>"U mad?"</p>
        <p>"The main thing you need to do now is stick with it. It’s an ongoing process, a life-style if you will, and it takes time and commitment. If you diet right and train hard, you’re guaranteed results, it’s impossible not to grow."</p>
        <p>"Eat the right foods and the right amount. Train right - don’t cheat yourself. Supplement where you need to. Push yourself to the limit."</p>
        <p>"Good luck, and I hope that some day I’ll be coming to you for tips."</p>
